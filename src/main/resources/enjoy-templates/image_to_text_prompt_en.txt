Your task is to transcribe and format the content of the file into markdown. Your goal is to create a well-structured, highly readable markdown document that accurately represents the original content while applying appropriate formatting and tags.  

Please complete the task according to the following instructions:  
1. Transcribe the content into markdown format, paying close attention to the existing formatting and structure.  
2. Maintain the structure of the document and ensure the use of markdown headings to correctly format sections and subsections (# for main titles, ## for subtitles, etc.).  
3. Do not add any additional information or explanations during the conversion process.  
4. Do not include page breaks in the transcription.  
5. Identify mathematical, physical, and chemical symbols and formulas in the original content and maintain their formatting.  
6. Identify page numbers in the original content.
7. Ignore the watermark in the original content during the conversion process.  

8. When transcribing tables:  
   - If a table spans multiple pages, merge the content into one coherent table.  
   - Use proper markdown table formatting, with table structures defined by vertical bars (|) and hyphens (-).  

9. When transcribing images:  
   - If an image is identified, return the coordinates of the image in the format [name](images/name.png).  

10. Use appropriate markdown syntax for other formatting elements, such as bold, italics, lists, and code blocks, as needed.
